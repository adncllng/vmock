#### **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City (QC, Canada) in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts, 2015) in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal after completing her final year of studies in the Republic of Ireland. Veronica has since returned to Tiohtià:ke/Montréal where she works as an artist. At the moment, Veronica is also conducting research-creation in performance art, public pedagogy and oral history within Concordia University’s unique INDI Graduate Program. Her work with individuals, groups, communities and coalitions deals with public representation, knowledge creation and social justice mobilization. Her collaborative and socially engaged art, which takes the form of relational performances, public addresses, video art and new media interventions, has been featured in gallery exhibitions, art and film festivals, as well as in conferences and symposia in South America, the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. The artist co-founded Visible in 2017, an art collective that highlights the power of expression of Montrealers in plural, media and performative gatherings. In 2019, Veronica also co-founded Womxn Walk the Walk, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. The collective investigates ways to counter the disempowerment of female identity in public space. Veronica has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad, from arts councils, government entities, academic and artistic institutions and community initiatives. The artist's dialogic art practice draws from theories and practices in public pedagogy, oral history, documentary, activism, community development, art education, and more.

Veronica's research-creation project at Concordia University is entitled _Real Face Time as Art: Unscripted Speaking and Listening._ It is concerned with the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when people listen to and talk about personal experiences and points of view with public _others_. Veronica is looking at how to facilitate such interactions and how—when devised as contemporary dialogic art—these gatherings transform participating interlocutors in progressive socio-political engagement. Her research is supported by the Acts of Listening Lab (Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling) under the primary supervision of Canada's Research Chair (RC) in Oral History Performance Luis C. Sotelo Castro, and the secondary supervisions of Concordia's RC in Socially Engaged Art and Public Pedagogies Kathleen Vaughan and Canada's RC in Oral History Steven High.

#### **Artist Statement**

I collaborate with people so that they can themselves present their reality in specific public settings. I hope that my work can fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I work on projects in and out of the gallery space by collaborating with individuals in the white cube and by summoning different audiences to listen to these same individuals in alternative spaces. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of colonialism, neoliberalism and individualism. My position as a white, Western, straight, typical, human comes with social privileges. Every day, I try to work towards better understanding my privileged position and its implication on art-making and collaboration with other people. My goal is to explore, through performance, pedagogy and activism, how people can determine their own representation in the public realm. The practice of presenting discourse that is not mine is an ethically, politically and aesthetically complex endeavour. I learn from this complexity every day—it's what motivates me. 

#### **Curriculum Vitae**

Mockler's art has been described as a "call to action" "blending humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question". — La Presse, 2019
