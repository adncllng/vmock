#### **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts) in 2015 after living and studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland. Mockler has since been based in Montreal where she lives and works as a professional artist making socially engaged dialogic art. She is pursuing a Master's degree at Concordia University (Master of Arts INDI). Her research delves deeply into the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when a person shares a personal experience with someone else. Mockler is looking at the facilitation of these interactions and how they can be devised as contemporary art. Her work has been featured in exhibitions, festivals and conferences namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Ammerman Center's Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Third Shift Festival (Saint John, NB, Canada), Maison des Artistes Visuels (Winnipeg, MA, Canada) Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, ON, Canada), Manif d’art Biennale (Québec, QC, Canada), ATSA at Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, Eastern Bloc, Dazibao, Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal, Vidéographe (Montreal, QC, Canada). The artist is the co-founder of [Visible](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cdn-housing-experience-performance-1.5148645), a Montreal art collective that highlights the power of citizen expression through performative, digital and diversified gatherings. She also co-founded [Womxn Walk the Walk](https://womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com/) collective in Montreal, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. The artist has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad from various entities.

In her practice, Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the experiences of people living these realities. She brings beautifully real individuals to talk about their opinions and lives in performances, videos and media installations. Her pieces have been described as a "call to action" "blending \[of] humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question" (La Presse, 2019). This interdisciplinary artist draws from many fields and mediums, such as oral history, documentary, public pedagogy, community development, new media, performance, relational art, conceptual art and art education. 

#### **Artist Statement**

#### **"my goal is to create art that strengthens the agency of my collaborators. Being the artist who facilitates other people's representation is an ethically and aesthetically complex thing... this complexity is what drives me... motivates me..."**

I collaborate with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I collaborate on projects in and out of the gallery space by facilitating the self-assertion of folks in the white cube and by summoning sheltered audiences into alternative spaces to have them listen to Others' intersectional experiences. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of neoliberalism, colonialism, conservatism and capitalism. I am attempting to put my privilege as a white Canadian cis and straight human woman to good use by making art and doing research that can serve the agency of other people, which allows me to fulfill my own. I am always looking for new collaborative opportunities.
