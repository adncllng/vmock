Biography

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec city in 1991. She graduated from Concordia University in 2014 (BFA-Studio Arts) after studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland to complete her degree. Mockler has since been based in Montreal where she lives and works as a professional artist. Mockler’s social and relational artworks have been featured in numerous exhibitions and festivals, namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Intersections 16th Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, Canada), La Biennale Manif. d’Art Internationale (Québec, Canada), Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Eastern Bloc, Vidéographe and Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal (Montreal, Canada). At the moment, Mockler is conducting research as an INDI/MA student at Concordia University. Supported by the Acts of Listening Lab, her project looks at the Creation of Applied Performance Art for Citizen Self-Representation. Mockler has been the recipient of many awards and grants for her work both in Canada and abroad. In her art practice, Mockler works with individuals, groups and communities to represent their reality in the public realm. People and their experiences are often the main subject matter of the performances, videos and other nonfiction media content she produces. Veronica Mockler draws from methods in oral history, documentary and conceptual art to create projects that strengthen the agency of the people she works with. The ethics of representing the Other in art, and the complexity of social art practice are reflections that drive the artist in her research.

Statement

I work with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human interaction and virtual media connectedness. I believe that having real people share real stuff in front of other real people is Art because it consists of an action that can socially transform all parties involved - the folks participating in the artwork and the engaged audience. I develop projects in and out of the gallery space by addressing social biases in the white cube and by summoning sheltered audiences into different communities and realities. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the overthrow of rigid conservatism and capitalism. I am a white Canadian cis woman artist. I am attempting to put my privilege to good use by creating work that serves the agency of other people as well as mine. I am always looking for new collaborations.
