## **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec city in 1991. She graduated from Concordia University in 2014 (BFA Studio Arts) after studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland to complete her degree. Mockler has since been based in Montreal where she lives and works as a professional artist. Mockler describes her work as social and relational. Her pieces have been featured in numerous exhibitions and festivals, namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Intersections Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, Canada), La Biennale Manif. d’Art Internationale (Québec, Canada), ATSA at Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Eastern Bloc, Vidéographe, Dazibao, Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal (Montreal, Canada), and more. At the moment, Mockler is conducting research as an INDI/Master of Arts student at Concordia University in Montreal. Supported by the Acts of Listening Lab, her project looks at the Creation of Applied Performance Art for Citizen Self-Representation. The artist has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work both in Canada and abroad from different entities including the First Prize by the Montreal Arts Council's Patrons of the Arts.

In her practice, Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the experiences of people living these realities. She brings beautiful and real individuals to share their stories in live performances, videos and media installations. Her pieces have been described as "leaving you with a haunting question" (La Presse, 2019) as well as being a "blend\[ing] of humour with sobering realism" (The Link, 2019). This interdisciplinary artist draws from many fields and methods, such as oral history, documentary, community development, relational and conceptual art, performance studies and art education. Mockler has said that her goal is to create art that strengthens the agency of the people she works with. Bringing folks to represent themselves in the public sphere is an ethically complexe art practice. This complexity is what drives Mockler in her art making and research.

## **Artist statement**

I work with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human interaction and virtual media connectedness. I believe that having real people share real stuff in front of other real people is Art because it consists of an action that can socially transform all parties involved - the folks participating in my artworks, the engaged audiences and myself the artist. I develop projects in and out of the gallery space by addressing social biases in the white cube and by summoning sheltered audiences into different communities and realities. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the overthrow of rigid conservatism and capitalism. I am attempting to put my privilege as a white Canadian cis woman artist to good use by creating work that serves the agency of other people as well as mine. I am always looking for new collaborations.
