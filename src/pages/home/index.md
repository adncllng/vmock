#### **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts) in 2015 after living and studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland. Mockler has since been based in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal where she works as a professional artist creating socially engaged dialogic art. The artist is now conducting research-creation in performance art, social practice and public pedagogy, as well as in oral history. As a Master of Arts in Fine Arts student at Concordia University, she is pursuing an Individualized Program she designed for herself. Her research entitled *Real Face Time as Art: Speech Acts for Social Transformation* delves deeply into the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when people express personal experiences and points of view with Others. Mockler is looking at how to facilitate such interactions and how—when devised as contemporary art—these encounters can socially transform participating interlocutors and audiences. Her research is supported by the Acts of Listening Lab under the primary supervision of Canada's Research Chair in Oral History Performance. Mockler's work as an artist has been featured in exhibitions, festivals and conferences namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Ammerman Center's Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Third Shift Festival (Saint John, NB, Canada), Maison des Artistes Visuels (Winnipeg, MA, Canada) Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, ON, Canada), Manif d’art Biennale (Québec, QC, Canada), ATSA at Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, Eastern Bloc, Dazibao, Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal, Vidéographe (Tiohtià:ke/Montréal, QC, Canada). The artist is the co-founder of *[Visible](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cdn-housing-experience-performance-1.5148645)*, a Tiohtià:ke/Montréal art collective that highlights the power of citizen expression through performative, digital and diversified gatherings. She also co-founded *[Womxn Walk the Walk](https://womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com/)* collective in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. The artist has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad from various entities. The artist draws from many fields and practices: oral history, documentary, public pedagogy, community development, new media, performance, relational art, conceptual art, activism, and art education. 

*Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the experiences of the people living these realities. Her performances, experimental videos and installations have been described as a "call to action" "blending \[of] humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question"*. — (La Presse, 2019)

#### **Artist Statement**

I collaborate with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I work on projects in and out of the gallery space by collaborating with individuals on their self-assertion in the white cube and by summoning different audiences to listen to these same individuals in alternative spaces. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of colonialism, capitalism and individualism. My position as a white, Western, straight, typical, human comes with social privileges I cannot depart myself from. Every day, I intend to work on better understanding my position and its implication on my collaboration with other people. My goal is to create art that strengthens the agency of my collaborators. The practice of presenting discourse that is not my own is an ethically, politically and aesthetically complex endeavour. This complexity is what drives me—motivates me.
