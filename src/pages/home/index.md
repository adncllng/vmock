#### **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City (QC, Canada) in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts, 2015) in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal after completing her final year of studies in the Republic of Ireland. Veronica has since returned to Tiohtià:ke/Montréal where she works as an artist. Her work with individuals, groups, communities and coalitions deals with public representation, knowledge creation and social justice. Her collaborative and socially engaged art, which takes the form of relational performances, public addresses, video art and new media interventions, has been featured in gallery exhibitions, moving-image and art festivals as well as in conferences and symposia in South America, the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. The artist co-founded [](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cdn-housing-experience-performance-1.5148645)VISIBLE in 2017, an art collective that highlights the power of expression of Tiohtià:ke/Montréal inhabitants through plural and digital performative gatherings in non-institutional community spaces. Veronica has also co-founded the WOMXN WALK THE WALK collective, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers that investigates ways to counter disempowerment of female identity in public space. Veronica has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad, from arts councils, government entities, academic and artistic institutions and community initiatives. The artist's dialogic art practice draws from theories and practices in oral history, documentary essaying, public pedagogy, community development, activism, art education, and more. 

At the moment, Veronica is conducting research-creation in performance art, public pedagogy and oral history within the unique Individualized Graduate Program of Concordia University. Her research entitled *Real Face Time as Art: Speech Acts for Social Transformation* delves deeply into the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when people express personal experiences and points of view with public *others*. Mockler is looking at how to facilitate such interactions and how—when devised as contemporary dialogic art—these encounters can socially transform participating interlocutors and therefore, public courses of action. Her research is supported by the Acts of Listening Lab (Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling) under the primary supervision of Canada's Research Chair (RC) in Oral History Performance, and the secondary supervisions of Concordia's RC in Socially Engaged Art and Public Pedagogies and Canada's RC in Oral History.

*Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the non-actors, the real-life protagonists living these issues. Mockler's artworks have been described as a "call to action" "blending \[of] humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question"*. — (La Presse, 2019)

#### **Artist Statement**

So... I collaborate with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I work on projects in and out of the gallery space by collaborating with individuals on their self-assertion in the white cube and by summoning different audiences to listen to these same individuals in alternative spaces. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of colonialism, capitalism and individualism. My position as a white, Western, straight, typical, human comes with social privileges. Every day, I try to work towards better understanding my privileged position and its implication on art-making and collaboration with other people. My goal is to explore, through the sharing of expertise and art, how people can determine their own representation in the public realm. The practice of presenting discourse that is not mine is an ethically, politically and aesthetically complex endeavour. This complexity is what drives me, is what motivates me. I want to never stop learning.
