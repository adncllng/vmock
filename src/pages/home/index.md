**Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in 1991 on unceded indigenous land, today known as Quebec City, in a franco-anglo family of French settler and Irish immigrant lineage. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts, 2015) in Tiohtià:ke (Montréal) after completing her final year of studies in the Republic of Ireland. Veronica has since returned to Tiohtià:ke where she lives, learns, and works as a professional artist.

At the moment, Veronica is undertaking research and creation in an academic setting, where she is investigating performance art, public pedagogy, and oral history at Concordia University in an INDI graduate program. Her art practice in collaboration with individuals, groups, communities, and coalitions deals with auto-determination in public representation, knowledge creation, and social justice mobilization. Her socially engaged performances, public addresses and gatherings, video art and interview work, and new media interventions have been featured in gallery exhibitions, art and film festivals, as well as in conferences and symposia in South America, the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe.

Veronica and her collaborators have been the recipient of awards and funding for work both in Canada and abroad, from art councils, government entities, academic and artistic institutions, and community organizations. Veronica's art practice draws from past and present thinking in public pedagogy, oral history, documentary, activism, community development, and art education. Her work has been described as a "call to action" "blending humor with sobering realism" as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question" — La Presse, 2019.

The artist co-founded the Visible Art Collective in 2017,  a collaboration that highlights the power of Montreal residents by creating gatherings for dialogue that are plural, performative, and media-based. In 2019, Veronica co-founded Womxn Walk the Walk, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. This collective of womxn, composed of community collaborators, artists and researchers investigates walking and gathering as a way to connect with, and represent, female power in public space.

**Practice as Research**

Veronica's 'research-creation' project at Concordia University is entitled _Real Face Time as Art: Unscripted Speaking and Listening._ It is concerned with the power of face-to-face interaction. What pedagogically and politically transpires when people listen to and talk about personal experience and reflections with public _others_? How can an artist responsibly facilitate such interactions? How is unscripted speaking and listening art; how is it performance art (performance art here being the practice stemming from Western visual art's postmodern/conceptual turn)?

Veronica's research is supported by the Acts of Listening Lab (Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling) under the primary supervision of Canada's Research Chair (RC) in Oral History Performance Luis C. Sotelo Castro, and the secondary supervisions of Concordia's RC in Socially Engaged Art, and Public Pedagogies Kathleen Vaughan and Canada's RC in Oral History Steven High.

**Artist Statement**

I collaborate with people so that they can, themselves, speak about their reality in different public settings. I work on projects in and out of the gallery space by collaborating with individuals in the white cube and by summoning different audiences to listen to these same individuals in alternative spaces. I hope that my work can fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of colonial, neoliberal, and individualistic structures and predispositions. I am a straight, cis, neurotypical, and able-bodied white woman, descendent of Irish immigrants and French settlers. Today, this position comes with many privileges. Every day, I try to work towards better understanding my position and its implication on art-making, labor, and collaboration with other people. The practice of presenting discourse that is not mine is an ethically, politically, and aesthetically complex endeavor — I learn from this complexity every day.

My artistic contributions would not be possible if it weren't for the mobilizing and multifaceted contributions of the people I collaborate with who are not so-called 'artists'. Therefore, any financial (or capitalizable) compensation that stems from our work together is shared between collaborators and me, in an attentive, transparent, and deliberate manner that makes sense with the specifics of each unique collaboration.
