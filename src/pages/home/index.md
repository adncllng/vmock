#### **Biography**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts) in 2015 after living and studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland. Mockler has since been based in Montreal where she works as a professional artist creating socially engaged dialogic art. The artist is now conducting research-creation in performance art, art and public pedagogy, and oral history by pursuing a Master of Arts in Fine Arts at Concordia University through an Individualized Program she designed for herself. Her research entitled *Real Face Time as Art: Speech Acts for Social Transformation* delves deeply into the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when people express personal experiences and points of view with Other people. Mockler is looking at how to facilitate such interactions and how—when devised as contemporary art—these interactions can socially transform participating interlocutors and audiences. Her research is supported by the Acts of Listening Lab under the primary supervision of the Canada Research Chair in Oral History Performance. Mockler's work as an artist has been featured in exhibitions, festivals and conferences namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Ammerman Center's Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Third Shift Festival (Saint John, NB, Canada), Maison des Artistes Visuels (Winnipeg, MA, Canada) Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, ON, Canada), Manif d’art Biennale (Québec, QC, Canada), ATSA at Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, Eastern Bloc, Dazibao, Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal, Vidéographe (Montreal, QC, Canada). The artist is the co-founder of **[Visible](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cdn-housing-experience-performance-1.5148645)**, a Montreal art collective that highlights the power of citizen expression through performative, digital and diversified gatherings. She also co-founded **[Womxn Walk the Walk](https://womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com/)** collective in Montreal, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. The artist has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad from various entities.

#### Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the experiences of people living these realities. She brings beautifully real individuals to talk about their opinions and lives in performances, videos and media installations. Her pieces have been described as a "call to action" "blending \[of] humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question". This interdisciplinary artist draws from many fields such as oral history, documentary, public pedagogy, community development, new media, performance, relational art, conceptual art and art education. — (La Presse, 2019)

#### **Artist Statement**

I collaborate with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I collaborate on projects in and out of the gallery space by facilitating the self-assertion of folks in the white cube and by summoning sheltered audiences into alternative spaces to have them listen to Others' intersectional experiences. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of neoliberalism, colonialism and capitalism. I am attempting to put my privilege as a white Canadian cis and straight human woman to good use by making art and doing research that can serve the agency of other people, which allows me to fulfill my own. I am always looking for new collaborative opportunities.

#### **"My goal is to create art that strengthens the agency of my collaborators. Being the artist who facilitates other people's representation is an ethically and aesthetically complex thing... this complexity is what drives me... motivates me..."**
