Statement

Through video, performance and interview, I work with individuals to present their reality and voice to audiences in order to socially challenge these given audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology created between real human interaction and virtual media connectedness. I believe art is one of the rare remaining occasions in which human relatability can genuinely occur. This is why I use live performance and documentary practices as artistic mediums to counter discrimination. I am driven by the idea that the direct presence of someone is politically transformative and that one's existence and opinions are worthy of art; of the art space; of the art world. I develop work in and out of the gallery space by addressing social stigmas in the white cube and by summoning sheltered folks into the real world. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the overthrow of rigid conservative and capitalist ideals. By putting forth work that serves the agencies of other individuals and groups, I am also attempting to deconstruct my own privilege. I am always looking for new collaborators.
