I hold the act of representation socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the complex creative struggle for liberation from capitalism and imperialism. I am a cis, straight, white, neurotypical, and non-disabled human. This position comes with many privileges. Every day I work toward better understanding my responsibilities as an artist in solidarity with other realities. I could not do my work if weren't for the multifaceted expertise and generosity of the people I collaborate with. Any financial and material compensation that stems from collaborative work is shared between my collaborators and me through a transparent and mutual deliberation process based on each project's specificities.
