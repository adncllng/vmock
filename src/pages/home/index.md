## **Biography**

**[Click here for press coverage & C.V.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pcSGlaB7TiRl9mhwTmfmHmoX5Pqc_XN3/view?usp=sharing)**

Veronica Mockler was born in Quebec City in 1991. She graduated with Distinction from Concordia University (BFA Studio Arts) in 2015 after living and studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland during her degree. Mockler has since been based in Montreal where she lives and works as a professional artist making socially engaged relational art. She is pursuing a Masters' degree at Concordia University (Master of Arts INDI). Her research delves deeply into the power of face-to-face interaction and what politically transpires when a person shares a personal experience with someone else. Mockler is looking into the facilitation of such interactions and how they can be devised as art. Her work has been featured in exhibitions, festivals and conferences namely: Women Cinema Makers (Berlin, Germany), Ammerman Center's Biennial of Art and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Third Shift Festival (Saint John, NB, Canada), Maison des Artistes Visuels (Winnipeg, MA, Canada) Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, ON, Canada), Manif d’art Biennale (Québec, QC, Canada), ATSA at Place des Arts, Cinéma Sous les Étoiles, Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, Eastern Bloc, Dazibao, Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal, Vidéographe (Montreal, QC, Canada), and more. The artist is the co-founder of **[Visible](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cdn-housing-experience-performance-1.5148645)**, a Montreal art collective that highlights the power of citizen expression through performative, digital and diversified gatherings. She also co-founded **[Womxn Walk the Walk](https://womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com/)** collective in Montreal, a sister initiative to Brooklyn's League of Women Walkers. The artist has been the recipient of awards and grants for her work, both in Canada and abroad, from various entities.

In her practice, Veronica Mockler tackles a wide range of social issues by presenting the experiences of people living these realities. She brings beautifully real individuals to share their stories in live performances, videos and media installations. Her pieces have been described as a "call to action" "blending \[of] humour with sobering realism", as well as sometimes "leaving you with a haunting question" (La Presse, 2019). This interdisciplinary artist draws from many fields, methods and mediums, such as oral history, documentary, community development, new media, performance, relational and conceptual art as well as art pedagogy. Mockler has stated that her goal is to create art that strengthens the agency of the people she works with. Bringing folks to represent themselves in the public arena is an ethically complex art practice. This complexity is what drives Mockler in her art making and research.

## **Artist Statement**

I collaborate with people to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human connection and virtual media connectedness. I collaborate on projects in and out of the gallery space by facilitating the self-assertion of folks in the white cube and by summoning sheltered audiences to listen to different intersectional experiences in different spaces. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the deactivation of neoliberalism, colonialism, conservatism and capitalism. I am attempting to put my privilege as a white Canadian cis and straight woman artist to good use by creating work that can serve the agency of other people, as well as mine. I am always looking for new collaborative opportunities.
