Was interviewed by ATSA for their Augmented Reality podcast and invited my dear collaborator Joanna Guillaume to join me. We discussed our allyship and respective positionality as active agents in the role that art can play for anti-racist and pro-migrant rights struggle. QR code is up right now in Martin Luther King Park, CDN, Montr√©al. Also available on main podcast platforms!
