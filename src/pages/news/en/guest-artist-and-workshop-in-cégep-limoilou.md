  For my workshop, I introduced students to the writing of Latin-American
  philosopher Linda Alcoff and facilitated a student-led discussion around “The
  Problem of Speaking for Others” (Alcoff, 1991). I presented some past work and
  invited students to take part in a listening exercise to experience what is at
  stake when negotiating the ethics of representation.
