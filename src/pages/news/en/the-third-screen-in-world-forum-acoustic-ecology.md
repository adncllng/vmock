  The Third Screen is opening in Atlantic Centre for the Arts as part of the
  World Forum for Acoustic Ecology on March 24, 2023 (Florida). To support the
  dialogue-based approach evident in my work, the Forum has agreed to sponsor
  Montreal youth, Bénéwendé Segueda's attendance to the conference. The
  dialogism showcased in The Third Screen will be applied to the keynote speech
  in as Keynote Amanda Gutierrez will be in conversation with Bénéwendé on
  stage.
