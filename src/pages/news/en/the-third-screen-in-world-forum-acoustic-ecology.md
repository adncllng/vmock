  The Third Screen is opening in Atlantic Centre for the Arts as part of the
  World Forum for Acoustic Ecology on March 24, 2023 (Florida). To support the
  dialogue-based approach evident in my work, the Forum has agreed to sponsor
  Montreal youth (17 y-o), Bénéwendé Segueda's attendance to the conference. The
  dialogic approach showcased in The Third Screen video installation will be
  applied to the keynote speech in which Keynote Amanda Gutierrez will be in
  conversation with the Bénéwendé on stage.
