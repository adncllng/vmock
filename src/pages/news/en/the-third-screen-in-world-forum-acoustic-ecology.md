  The Third Screen is opening in the Atlantic Centre for the Arts as part of the
  WFAE in Florida on March 24, 2023. To support the dialogue-based approach
  evident at stake in my research, the WFAE has agreed to sponsor the attendance
  of Montreal youth, Bénéwendé Segueda. During the conference, the dialogic
  approach showcased in The Third Screen installation will be applied to the
  keynote presentation. Keynote Amanda Gutierrez will be in conversation with
  the young women on stage.
