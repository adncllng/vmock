  The Third Screen is opening in Atlantic Centre for the Arts as part of the
  World Forum for Acoustic Ecology on March 24, 2023 in Florida. To support the
  dialogue-based approach evident in my work, the Forum has agreed to sponsor 17
  y-o Montrealer Bénéwendé Segueda's participation in the Forum. The dialogism
  showcased in The Third Screen will be applied to the keynote speech in as
  Bénéwendé will join Keynote Amanda Gutierrez in conversation on stage.
