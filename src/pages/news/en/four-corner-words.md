  Intervention in public space at Place-des-arts. In this work, with WWW's
  collective intersectional reality as a starting and ending point, Amanda
  Gutierrez, Florencia Sosa Rey, Joanna Guillaume and myself are offering
  festival-goers four addenda that embody the identity, geographical, and
  political reorientations of these women, present, past, and future.
