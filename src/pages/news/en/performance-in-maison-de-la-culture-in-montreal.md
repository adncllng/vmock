title: Performance by Lala in Maison de la Culture
date: 1995-10-07T22:33:00.000Z
description: >
  "Les Interpr√®tes" opens on April 10, 2019 in Maison de la Culture du
  Plateau-Mont-Royal. My hope is that this live nonfiction performance goes
  against current documentary representations that gratuitously victimize and
  exploit the narratives of folks who have undergone migration.
