title: Premiere of performance part of Les InterprÃ¨tes!
date: 1995-10-07T22:33:00.000Z
description: >
  Performance opens in Maison de la Culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal. My hope is
  that this live nonfiction performance will go against current documentary
  representations that gratuitously victimize/exploit the narratives of folks
  having undergone migration.
