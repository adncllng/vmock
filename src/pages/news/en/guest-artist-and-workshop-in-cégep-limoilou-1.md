description: >-
  I introduced students to the writing of Latin-American philosopher Linda
  Alcoff and facilitated a student-led discussion around “The Problem of
  Speaking for Others” (Alcoff, 1991). Then we explored some of my part work and
  took part in a listening exercise to experience what is at stake when
  negotiating the ethics of representation.
