title: Back to High School for Two Months!
date: 2006-09-30T20:27:00.000Z
description: >-
  I am an Artist-in-Residence at a Montreal high school! I will be facilitating
  creation with 16 teenagers who have just recently immigrated to Canada. This
  is thanks to Centre Turbine, an art pedagogy organization dedicated to
  bringing contemporary artists into communities.
