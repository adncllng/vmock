üîó Check out the 8 Takeovers [HERE](https://en.dazibao.art/a-l-image-takeover) as they unfold for every exhibition.

_√Ä l'image ‚Äî Takeover_ is a participatory art series in which, over two years, a group of young Montrealers intervenes and responds to Dazibao‚Äôs exhibition programming, collaborating with each other and their mentor, artist Veronica Mockler. Exploring various embodied and digital art practices, the youth develop a critical dialogue around our exhibitions, which among other things manifests online on our website over the course of the series. Conceived and led by Mockler, this work aims to invite the situated perspective of youth on a range of topics related to each exhibition such as futurity, mobility, labor, environmental crisis, anticolonialism, and posthumanism. Secondly, it aims to give youth professional agency in the arts, in the realization, representation and communication of their ideas. Seven young women between the ages of 13 and 21 answered to the invitation posed by √Ä l'image ‚Äî Takeover thanks to the support and promotion of the project by Black community mobilizers in Montreal‚Äôs Little Burgundy neighborhood.

_The artist thanks Amanda Maxwell at Desta Black Community Network, as well as Ashley Montgomery and Vivek Venkatesh at Project Someone, Concordia University for their generous collaboration._ 

_This project is supported by the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Ville de Montr√©al and the Gouvernement du Qu√©bec in the context of the "Entente sur le deÃÅveloppement culturel de MontreÃÅal"._
