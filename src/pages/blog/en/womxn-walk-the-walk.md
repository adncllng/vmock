Mockler invited her friend Joanna Guillaume to participate in Women Walk the Walk, a collective initiated a few month ago in Montreal by Amanda Gutierrez and Mockler. Within the collective, Mockler and Guillaume are together looking at what it means for Guillaume — who does not consider herself an artist nor having participated previously in a similar activity — to take part in this collective. Working through ideas of allyship, collaboration, facilitation and friendship-based research, the two women are working on a public performance in which Guillaume shares a personal experience in front of an audience. Guillaume's story deals with the disillusionment she experienced when her militant class "comrades" in Université d'État d'Haiti (Port-au-Prince) viewed the struggle of women in Haiti as a low priority in the struggle for social justice. Out of 32 students, Guillaume was at that time one of two women admitted in the Philosophy department. 

Guillaume arrived to Canada as a Refugee claimant from Haiti in 2015. The artist met Guillaume a few months later in a twinning program for Refugee women that pairs a newly arrived Refugee to someone who has been based in Montreal for some years.

Femmxs Marcheuses de Montréal (Women Walk the Walk) is a collective of artists, researchers and community members who explore issues and stories of female identity in public space. For more information on their investigation, visit [womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com](https://womenwalkmontreal.tumblr.com/). 

Womxn Walk the Walk is the sister initiative of Brooklyn League of Women Walkers, co-founded by Amanda Gutierrez.
