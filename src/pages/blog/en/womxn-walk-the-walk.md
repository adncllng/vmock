  Artists, researchers and community members exploring stories of female
  identity in public space
---
Participants from different backgrounds are invited to take part in Femmxs Marcheuse de Montréal’s Womxn Walk the Walk workshops, a series of walk-workshops led by five core group members in Montréal, QC Canada (Amanda Gutierrez, Florencia Sosa Rey, Joanna Guillaume, Kathy Kennedy and Veronica Mockler). Before and after each walk, the collective convenes to share and reflect upon personal experiences in relation to being a womxn in public space. The sharing of expertise and "workshopping together" is the structure that guides this fluid collective during its meetings. Exercises in oral history, sound, movement and writing allow the group to investigate together personal histories of public intersectional womxnhood, inclusivity, allyship and \[dis]empowerment. The walk-workshops also inform public performances that bridge oral history performance, critical cartography, psychogeography and sound mapping as main tools for the engagement and listening of personal feminist narratives. 

Mockler invited her friend Joanna Guillaume to participate in this collective. Mockler and Guillaume are together looking at what it means for Guillaume — who does not consider herself an artist nor having participated previously in a similar activity — to take part in this collective. Working through ideas of allyship, collaboration, facilitation and friendship-based research, the two women amongst the collective are working on a public performance in which Guillaume shares a personal experience in front of an audience. Guillaume's story deals with the disillusionment she experienced when her militant class "comrades" in Université d'État d'Haiti (Port-au-Prince) viewed the struggle of women in Haiti as a low priority in the struggle for social justice. Out of 32 students, Guillaume was at that time one of two women admitted in the Philosophy department. 

Guillaume arrived to Canada as a Refugee claimant from Haiti in 2015. The artist met Guillaume a few months later in a twinning program for Refugee women that pairs a newly arrived Refugee to someone who has been based in Montreal for some years.
