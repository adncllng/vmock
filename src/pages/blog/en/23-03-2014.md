  Ongoing performance in which invited collaborators and I answer a personal
  question publicly.
---
This performance took place on March 23, 2014, in the Belgo Building. It was performed for the camera of filmmaker and director Marianne Métivier for her short documentary on up and coming performance art in Montreal. 

Participants, including myself, answer a personal question in front of a camera (sometimes also in front of an audience). The question is predetermined by myself (the artist) and shared with co-participants a few days prior to the performance. We shall not share our answers with anyone else prior to the performance. Our answers are to be unrehearsed and unscripted. At the end of the performance, in front of the camera, the participants and I sign an agreement stating that I shall reach out in years to come (a minimum of three years) to revisit together the footage. Each participant’s reaction when viewing this personal time-capsule is also video-documented in due time.

"_She \[the artist] conceived, and subtly structured, very simple situations that asked us to sit and listen to someone - who was not an actor or an artist \[except the artist herself] - speak. They spoke about something that had happened to them or had mattered to them, and the experience of hearing them was impactful._" - Lynn Hugues, Professor Emerita, Concordia University
