  A video triptych on how we seek validation through the approval of others both
  in life and online.
---
In this work, Mockler brings four individuals together to satisfy the spectator's constant need to be noticed. Installed as a triptych, this video installation swarms the viewer with the amount of enthusiasm and attention they have secretly been craving for, both in life and online. In a time when attention and social approval has become a high-stake capital, the work questions what it means to be liked.
