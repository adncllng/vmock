  Three-channel video on the expanding need for validation.
---
In this work, Mockler brings four individuals together to satisfy the spectator's constant need to be noticed. These three life-size projections overwhelm the viewer with enthusiasm and satiate their over-growing need for attention, both in real life and online. In our times where recognition and social approval have become such a high-stakes venture, the work explores this incessant need to be liked. The reinforcement of our self-esteem, which was previously garnered from real people around us has now evolved into a cyber craving that drives us to solicit the approval of perfect strangers.
