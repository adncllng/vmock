  Ongoing documentary work on the public representation of Nati's story and
  sexual violence activism.
---
This ongoing documentary work is about Natasha (Nati), a young woman who sought out me back in 2018 to ask if I could help her tell her story. We first met in a coffee shop, which we left minutes later to find a more private place to talk. Natasha went on to present herself as a 21-year-old Montreal-born woman who was first sexually assaulted at the age of 7. She recounted how she had survived six cases of sexual violence perpetrated by different men. Nati identifies as a "Lao-Salvadore√±a activist against sexual violence, a rape survivor, and a suicide attempt survivor" (taken from Natasha's Instagram bio). At the age of 21, Natasha decided to publicly address, through video logs on social media, the sexual abuse, incest, and misogyny she has experienced in her lifetime. 

Listening to Nati is an in-progress documentary work in which I look at the ways in which I can help Natasha share her story through non-fiction and art. Containing interviews, audio, video and photo documents, performances and reenactments, public consultations, and reflexive interventions by the artist, this documentary work investigates Nati's life, our relationship and collaboration, as well as sexual violence story-telling.
