  A provisional relational work in which I spent time with a woman I did not
  know during one afternoon.

Nadia and I did not know each other when I asked her if I could take her portrait. Nadia was the concierge in my apartment building at the time. She without any hesitation agreed and invited me into her home the following week. In this early relational work, I saw the series of photographs as a pretext for exchangeâ€”a setting in which a 21-year old woman (my age at the time) was invited to learn from an older woman, a mother, a wife, a worker, an immigrant. My wanting 'to spend time with Nadia', someone I had only said 'hello' to a few times prior, is when I began to understand how connection and one-on-one interaction with other people could at once be the form, the method and the actual content of my work. 

Nadia and I only met once. That afternoon, I took photographs of Nadia in different rooms of her apartment. I also met Nadia's husband and teenage son. We shared several cups of Turkish coffee while Nadia showed me pictures of her dearly missed family in Moldova. Nadia told me that a year after immigrating to Canada, she had to go back to Moldova because she had been suffering from depression caused by homesickness. When I left, Nadia insisted I take a case of 12 juice pouches with me.

Later on, I painted a portrait of Nadia based on the photographs I had taken of her, and the time and space we had shared. I lost contact with Nadia and never had the opportunity to show her the painting.
