  Relational work in which the artist spends time with a woman who takes care of
  her apartment building

Nadia and the artist did not know one another when Mockler asked if she could take Nadia's portrait. Nadia was the concierge in Mockler's apartment building at the time. Nadia unhesitatingly agreed and invited the artist into her home the following week. In this relational work, Mockler sees the series of photographs as a pretext for exchange - a pretext for Mockler (who was 21 years old at the time) to learn from a woman, mother, wife and immigrant. This need "to spend time with Nadia" is when Mockler began understanding how interacting one-on-one with people was the raw material from which she would create - had a responsibility to create. 

Mockler and Nadia only met once. During that afternoon, Mockler took pictures of 

 we chatted and she showed me her family pictures. When I left she offered me a case of 12 juice pouches.
