  Relational work in which the artist spends time with a woman who takes care of
  her apartment building

Nadia and the artist did not know one another when Mockler asked if she could take Nadia's portrait. Nadia was the concierge in Mockler's apartment building at the time. Nadia unhesitatingly agreed and invited the artist into her home the following week. In this relational work, Mockler sees the series of photographs as a pretext for exchange - a pretext for Mockler (who was 21 years old at the time) to learn from a woman, mother, wife and immigrant. This need "to spend time with Nadia" is when Mockler began understanding how one-on-one interaction with people could be raw material from which to work from. 

Mockler and Nadia only met once. During that afternoon, Mockler took pictures of Nadia in different rooms of her apartment. The artist met Nadia's husband and teenage son. The two women shared several cups of Turkish coffee, throughout which Nadia showed pictures of her dearly missed family in Moldova. Nadia told the artist that a year after immigrating to Canada, she had needed to go back to Moldova because had suffered from depression caused by her homesickness. Nadia was sweet, humble amazingly strong, and

 we chatted and she showed me her family pictures. When I left she offered me a case of 12 juice pouches.
