The First Listing is a performance part of a series developed initially in 2012. During this live performance, I list aloud everything that I am and everything that I am not in front of an audience. This public articulation enables an interesting kind of positioning and accountability in that it allows me to maintain perspective, humility and attentiveness over time. Knowing and stating publicly where I came from and where I am now, guides where I should go. In the next phases of this ongoing project, I intend on expanding the process and inviting other individuals to participate. 

Following is the documentation of the Second Listing which took place on January 11, 2014. This performance was part of Doubletake: An event of potentiality, a group exhibition curated by Naakita Feldman-Kiss in Gallery Lock, Montr√©al, QC Canada.
