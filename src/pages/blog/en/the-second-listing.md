The First Listing is a performance part of a series the artist developed initially in 2012. The artist lists aloud everything that she is and everything she is not in front of an audience. 

Following is the documentation of the second listing which took place on January 11, 2014. This performance was part of DOUBLETAKE: AN EVENT OF POTENTIALITY a group exhibition curated by Naakita Feldman-Kiss in Gallery LOCK, Montr√©al Canada.
