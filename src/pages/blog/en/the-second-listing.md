  Performance in which I list a who she is and who she is not as a human being.
---
The Second Listing is a performance part of a series developed initially in 2012. During this live performance, I list aloud everything that I am and everything that I am not in front of an audience. This exercise provokes accountability and is crucial in maintaining perspective, humility, and attentiveness over time — knowing and stating publicly where I came from and where I am now, guides where you want to go. In the next phases of this ongoing project, I intend on expanding the process and inviting other individuals to participate. 

Following is the documentation of the Second Listing which took place on January 11, 2014. This performance was part of Doubletake: An event of potentiality, a group exhibition curated by Naakita Feldman-Kiss in Gallery Lock, Montréal, QC Canada.
