description: Documentary performances featuring 8 residents of Côte-des-Neiges.
---
Rivières is a series of documentary performances I co-created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin. At the intersection of performance, installation and documentary, this work is about the lives and experiences of eight individuals living in Côte-des-Neiges. The documentary performances were based on two elements: a soundtrack playing the edited version of an audio interview conducted by us, and the physical presence of these same residents in front of the audience. Over the course of two days, hundreds of Montrealers wandered through the halls of the borough’s community center to meet and listen to these eight strangers, face-to-face.

VISIBLE ART COLLECTIVE, co-founded by the artist and Sofia Blondin, would like to thank the City of Montreal – vive375mtl fund, the Arrondissement Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Theatre Engaging Communities Program of the National Theatre School of Canada and the Centre Communautaire de Loisir de Côte-des-Neiges.
