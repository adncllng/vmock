  Documentary performances featuring eight residents who live and work in
  Côte-des-Neiges
---
Rivières is a series of documentary performances Mockler co-created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin. At the intersection of performance, installation and documentary, this work is about the lives and experiences of eight individuals living in Côte-des-Neiges. The documentary performances were based on two elements: a soundtrack playing the edited version of an audio interview conducted by the two women artists, and the physical presence of these same residents in front of the audience. Over the course of two days, hundreds of Montrealers wandered through the halls of the borough’s community center to meet these eight complete strangers face-to-face and understand their stories. 

VISIBLE would like to thank the City of Montreal – vive375mtl fund, the Arrondissement Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Theatre Engaging Communities Program of the National Theatre School of Canada and the Centre Communautaire de Loisir de Côte-des-Neiges.
