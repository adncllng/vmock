description: Documentary performances featuring 8 residents of Côte-des-Neiges.
---
At the intersection of performance, installation and documentary, Rivières is about the lives and experiences of eight individuals living in Côte-des-Neiges: Salamata, Jun, Eunice, Modibo, Wazen Mado, Madeleine, et Marc (in order of appearance). The documentary performances were based on two elements: a soundtrack playing the edited version of an audio interview conducted by us, and the physical presence of these same residents in front of the audience. Over the course of two days, hundreds of Montrealers wandered through the halls of the borough’s community center to meet and listen to these eight strangers, face-to-face.

Rivières is a series of documentary performances I created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin and technical designer Émile Lafortune
