  Oral history project on the lives and resilience of Susana Hennessey and Bobby
  Lavery.
---
Athléimneacht is an ongoing project the artist is developing during her visits to the north of Ireland. Interested in what it means to “pay hommage to someone”, the artist is documenting the stories and resilience of Bobby and Susana Lavery, a retired socialist Irish-American couple she met randomly in an Icelandic airport in February 2017. Since this initial encounter, Mockler has traveled to Belfast to spend time with, and learn from, Susana and Bobby. In this work, the artist is drawing from reflexions and practices belonging to the socialist and radical genealogy of Oral History¹. Mockler is articulating these practices through documented conversations and performances with the Laverys. 

Amongst many other things, Bobby is a former North Belfast City Councillor (elected 3 terms) and sentenced Long Kesh prisoner. During the Northern-Irish conflict, Bobby’s 21-year old son was killed by two gunmen. Bobby's life dedication to the Republican struggle as well as his radical activism for class equality is at the basis of this joint "hommage". Susana, for her part, has been an instrumental actor for the San Francisco Bay area's health equity and social justice public program implementation. She was a former supervisor at La Clinica de La Raza, an activist led multi-service clinic that provides healthcare to low-income and undocumented Latino residents of the East Bay area of Oakland, CA. Susana’s first husband died of HIV/AIDS during their 7th year of marriage. Susana's resilience, life's work and generous advocacy is at the heart of this joint "hommage".
