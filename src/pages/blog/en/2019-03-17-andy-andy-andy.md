  Ongoing nonfiction media art project on the lives of Susana Hennessy and Bobby
  Lavery.
---
Athléimneacht is an ongoing nonfiction media art project the artist is developing during her visits to Northern Ireland. Interested in the ethics and practice of “paying hommage to someone”, the artist is documenting the stories and resilience of Bobby and Susana Lavery, a retired Irish-American couple who she has become dear friends with. 

_**Amongst many many other things,**_ Bobby is a former North Belfast City Councillor (elected 3 terms) and sentenced Long Kesh prisoner. Bobby’s 21-year old son was killed by two gunmen during the Northern-Irish conflict. 

**_Amongst many many other things,_** Susana is a former supervisor at La Clinica de La Raza, an activist led multi-service clinic that provides healthcare to low-income and undocumented Latino and Chicano residents in the East Bay area of Oakland, CA. She has been awarded for her work in health equity and social justice in San Francisco. Susana’s first husband died of HIV/AIDS during their 7th year of marriage.
