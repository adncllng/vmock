description: The Resilience Archive / Susana and Bobby
---
The Resilience Archive is an ongoing artwork structured in 3 parts. Each part presents the stories and images of a lineage of resilience. Part 1 entitled Athléimneacht follows the Lavery/Hennessey family. Containing video, audio, performance, images and historical records, Athléimneach evolves around the militancy of Susana Hennessey (health equity & social justice - California, USA) and Bobby Lavery (Belfast city council, Republican Long Kesh prisonner - Belfast, NI U.K.). 

This work and hommage unfolds visually in different ways according to space or platform.
