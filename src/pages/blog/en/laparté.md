  The artist asks friends and strangers to share whatever they want in front of
  a camera.

I placed a camera in front of eight individuals who were sitting in a place that is personally relevant to them (their bedroom, office, local coffee shop, etc.). There is no time limit and no direction. Some of the participants are strangers, some of them I knew. Some had time to prepare, some didn't—it happened on the spot, as I entered their laundromat. Each person could say or do whatever they wanted as I left them alone with the camera. The raw and unpredictable nature of this work is a testament to the complex relationship I have with the role of narrative authority in documentary practice, media representation and performance. This loosening of the reins creates an opening for self-determination, which is of great interest to me. Holding space for the vulnerability that stems from the unscripted, the unsensational, the unspectacular is sort of a 'demand of mine' in the arts.
