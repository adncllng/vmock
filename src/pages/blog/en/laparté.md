description: The artist places a camera in front of six random individuals.

This study is about self-determination and its application in the documentary representation of subjects. The artist places six individuals alone in front of a camera. There is no time limit, no direction. Each participants can say or do what they want. The raw and unpredictable nature of this work is a testament to the artist's complicated relationship with narrative authority.
