description: The artist places a camera in front of eight randomly chosen people
---
The artist places eight individuals alone in front of a camera. There is no time limit and no direction. Some of the participants are strangers, some of them the artist knows. Mockler walked into coffee shops, laundromats, etc. and asked people if they wanted to participate. Each person could say or do whatever they wanted. The raw and unpredictable nature of this work is a testament to the artist's complex relationship with the role of narrative authority in documentary making. This loosening of the reins creates an opening for self-determination, which is of great interest to the artist.
