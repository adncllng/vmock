description: Collaborative research-creation study on the interview experience of strangers
---
Together with community collaborators Azzouz, Joanna, Kevin and Sheida, we investigated the practice of life story interviewing between strangers. In this documentary three-channel video installation viewers of the work become listeners of what this interview experience has meant to those involved rather than being given access to the actual interviews.

This work was presented as part of my Master of Arts in Fine Arts thesis, and was unveiled to the general public in December 2021 at Concordia University's Acts of Listening Lab within the Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.
