  Collaborative research-creation study on the interview experience of
  strangers.
---
Together with community collaborators Azzouz, Joanna, Kevin and Sheida, we investigated the practice of life story interviewing between strangers. In this documentary three-channel, video installation viewers of the work become listeners of what this interview experience has meant to those involved rather than being given access to their actual interviews.

This work was presented as part of my Master of Arts in Fine Arts thesis and was unveiled to the general public in December 2021. The exhibition was hosted by the Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling and the Acts of Listening Lab.

_Without Azzouz, Joanna, Kevin and Sheida's expertise, generosity, openness and trust, this work would not have been possible._

_Thank you to Alana DeVito, Josue Moncada and Roby Provost-Blanchard for their precious technical help._
