  Series of documentary interventions / 16 teenagers / École secondaire
  Jeanne-Mance
---
The artist created a series of performances with 16 teenagers who have just recently arrived to Canada. These performances, which she imagines and produces with the students, are about their experiences, opinions and representation. Performed for the camera or for a live audience through the use of different documentary and performative conventions, the students week after week, conceptually reflect on the ways in which their self-documentation can occur, and the social importance of their depiction in a context such as Montreal; Québec; Canada. Praxes such as declaration, hommage, confidentiality, verbatim, speculation, manifesto, testimony are explored and embodied by the group. Les Interprètes is an experimental moment in which these teenagers are given back authorship and control of their own narrative and image. 

This work is made in collaboration with the Centre Turbine centreturbine.org/les-interpretes, thanks to the funding of Fonds dédiés aux écoles publiques, provided by the City of Montreal's Plateau-Mont-Royal arrondissement.
