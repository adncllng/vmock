  teenagers.

The artist did a six-week residency in a Montreal high school in April 2018. During her time there, she created a series of performances with 16 teenagers who had just recently immigrated to Montreal, Québec, Canada. With the students, Mockler explored what it means to express oneself as a teenager and the control one has at that age over self-representation. Interested in their daily lives and preoccupations, the artist asked the teenagers to talk about themselves in different performative settings. She used different formats to prompt each exercise (verbatim, speculation, interview, manifesto, testimony, declaration, hommage, censorship, and more).

In _Les Interprètes,_ the artist’s aim was to make her audience aware of the actual thoughts and discourses of young people who have immigrated. Mockler wanted to go against documentary tendencies that gratuitously victimize and exploit the narratives of individuals who have undergone migration. She sees _Les Interprètes_ as an experimental moment in which the teenagers were given control over their own depiction. 

The artist would like to thank the Centre Turbine, the Fonds dédiés aux écoles publiques provided by the city of Montreal's Plateau-Mont-Royal Arrondissement, Jeanne-Mance High School, the Maison de la culture du Plateau-Mont-Royal, the ATSA and the Cinéma Sous les Étoiles de Funambules Média.
