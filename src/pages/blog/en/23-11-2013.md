  Ongoing performance in which participants and the artist answer a personal
  question publicly
---
This performance took place on November 11, 2013.

Participants, including the artist herself, answer a personal question in front of a camera (sometimes in front of an audience also). The question is predetermined by the artist and shared with the participants a few days prior to the performance. Participants do not share their answers with anyone prior to the performance. Their answers are unrehearsed and unscripted. At the end of the performance, in front of the camera, the participants and the artist sign an agreement stating that Mockler will reach out in years to come (minimum of three years) to revisit together the footage. Every participants' reaction when viewing this personal time-capsule is also video-documented by the artist in due time. 

_"She \[the artist] conceived, and subtly structured, very simple situations that asked us to sit and listen to someone - who was not an actor or an artist - speak. They spoke about something that had happened to them or had mattered to them, and the experience of hearing them was impactful."  -_ Lynn Hugues, Professor Emerita, Concordia University
