  Performance for the camera in which participants answer a question honestly.
---
This performance took place on November 11th, 2013. Participants, including the artist herself, answer a personal question in front of a camera (sometimes also in front of an audience). The question is predetermined by the artist. She shares it with the participants a few days prior to the performance so that they can reflect on what they want to say. The participants and the artist sign an agreement stating that Mockler will reach out in years to come (minimum of three years) so that they can revisit together the performance's video-documentation. Every participants' reaction when viewing their personal time-capsule will also be video-documented by the artist in due time. 

This performance is the first of a series that follows the same structure.
