  Performance for the camera in which participants answer a question honestly.
---
This performance took place on November 11th, 2013. Participants, including the artist herself, answer a personal question in front of a camera (sometimes in front of an audience also). The question is predetermined by the artist and shared with the participants a few days prior to the performance. Participants do not share their answers prior to the performance. Their answers are genuine and unscripted. The participants and the artist sign an agreement stating that Mockler will reach out in years to come (minimum of three years) so that they can revisit together their answers. Every participants' reaction when viewing this personal time-capsule is also video-documented by the artist in due time. 

This performance is the first of a series that follows the same structure.
