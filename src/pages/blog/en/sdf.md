Visible (an art collective cofounded by actress Sofia Blondin and social relational artist Veronica Mockler) created The Address, a commission performance by [Amplifier Group](http://amplifier-amplifier.com). In The Address, Visible invited hundreds and hundreds of Montrealers to dive deep into issues relating to the right to housing. Different citizens were brought to perform and share their perspectives on the situation in CÃ´te-des-Neiges borough of Montreal. The audience was invited to a non-institutional space in the neighbourhood and listen to the experiences of tenants, owners, community actors, activists, inspectors and urban planners. These citizens/performers shared their personal and socio-political reality in an interdisciplinary format (oral history, documentary, video). The Address was a horizontal et circular space for citizens to represent and mobilize one anOther about the urgency of the right to housing in Montreal.
