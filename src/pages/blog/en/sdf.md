  Series of citizen ethno-documentary performances about the right to housing
---
The Address is a series of performances Mockler co-created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin. This work was commissioned by Amplifier Group. The Address invited hundreds of Montrealers to dive deeply into the issues pertaining to the Right to Housing. Different stakeholders were brought in to perform and share their experiences regarding the housing situation in the Côte-des-Neiges borough of Montreal. In a neutral setting within the neighbourhood, the audience saw a live presentation by tenants, owners, community actors, activists, inspectors and urban planners on these issues. The participants shared their personal and socio-political realities directly with the audience in an interdisciplinary format (oral history, documentary, video and live performance). The Address was a horizontal and circular space where citizens could represent and mobilize together in an attempt to deal with the urgent and challenging issues facing them.
