  Series of ethnographic & documentary performances on the Right to Housing.
---
**The Address** is a series of performances Veronica Mockler co-created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin. This work was commissioned by the ethnography group **[Amplifier](http://amplifier-amplifier.com/)**. **The Address** invited hundreds of Montrealers to dive deeply into issues pertaining to the Right to Housing in the city. Different stakeholders were brought in to share their experiences regarding the housing situation in Côte-des-Neiges borough of Montreal. Taking place in a transformed education centre in the Triangle, the public assisted in live presentations by tenants, owners, community actors, activists, inspectors and urban planners on this multifold issue. By sharing their personal and social reality directly with the audience in an interdisciplinary format (oral history, documentary, video installation and live performance), The Address became a circular  and critical space where residents living in the area could discuss and moreover mobilize together in an attempt to deal with the urgent challenge their communities and families are facing. Elected officials assisted to a performance which led amongst other transformations to the launching of an investigation by the city into a series of rooming-house targeting newly arrived immigrants.

**The Address** was co-produced by *Visible Art Collective* (Veronica Mockler and Sofia Blondin) and Amplifier. It was informed by the 360° ethnography project Amplifier led in the summer of 2017 in Côte-des-Neiges.

## Visible Art Collective would first and foremost like to thank Bénéwendé, Anna Maria, Bakr, Ismael, John, Line, Aida and Ahmed for partaking in **The Address** and sharing their experiences, convictions and personal thoughts with Montrealers.

**The Address** would not have come to life without the artistic and technical contributions of Émile Lafortune.

*Visible Art Collective* would like to thank *Cégep Marie-Victorin* for welcoming us into their space. *Visible Art Collective* would like to thank the *Conseil des Arts de Montréal*'s *Patron of the Arts Prize* and the *Theatre Engaging Communities Program* of the *National Theatre School of Canada* for their financial support in this project.
