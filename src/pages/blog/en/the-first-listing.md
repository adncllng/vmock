  A performance by the artist about what she is, and what she is not, as a
  person.

The First Listing is a performance part of a series the artist developed initially in 2012. The artist lists aloud everything that she is and everything she is not in front of an audience. The work has become a series since this first edition.

This work was presented in the Intermedia-Cyberart Performances in Concordia University in January 2012.
