The First Listing is a performance part of a series developed initially in 2012. During this live performance, I list aloud everything that I am and everything that I am not in front of an audience. This exercise provokes accountability and is crucial in maintaining perspective, humility and attentiveness over time â€” knowing and stating publicly where I came from and where I am now, guides where you want to go. In the next phases of this ongoing project, I intend on expanding the process and inviting other individuals to participate. 

This performance's iteration was presented at Concordia University in January 2012.
