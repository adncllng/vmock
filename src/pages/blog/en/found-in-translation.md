I invited three of my dear collaborations, sound artist Amanda Guti√©rrez, performance artist Florencia Sosa Rey and social worker Joanna Guillaume to come together to embody the reality of listening and intersectionality. In this conversation between two womxn who speak different languages, two trusted friends (Sosa Rey and myself) take on the role of live translators and attempt to communicate in real-time, the spoken experience of each participant. The palpable trust between us, which has been nurtured over two years of getting to know each other and collaboration, allows for a specific type of storytelling and interpretation to take place; a fertile ground for my interest in the pedagogical and artistic properties of unscripted listening and speaking.
