  Artist-in-Residence at Maison des Artistes (Winnipeg, MA) for community-based
  research-creation
---
Eleven new and established Franco-Manitobans participated in a series of workshops in Winnipeg that were developed and facilitated by the artist along with art pedagogue Yves Amyot from Centre Turbine (Montreal, QC). Mockler was invited as Artist-in-Residence at the Maison des Artistes to conduct research-creation with members of the french speaking community of Winnipeg. During her workshops, participants interacted with one another about their personal experience and identity as francophones. Looking at "la francophonie" through the lens of conflict, de/colonialism, migration, family and culture, Mockler collected different types of audio-visual and performative content that features the life-chapters and convictions of each participant. 

Mockler is invited to go back to Winnipeg's Maison de Artistes in December 2019 to present "Pavillon", a portion of the body of work she produced with participants during her residency.

Opening: December 5, 2019 (Exhibition is on until February 2020). Discussion with participants and artist (open to public): December 7, 2019 (Time TBA).
