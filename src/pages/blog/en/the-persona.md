description: Single-channel video performance exploring party-girl persona
---
In this video performance, the artist gets drunk and dances to music in front of a camera. Partying, as a social activity and character trait, is here isolated for observation. With this action, Mockler wants to investigate why she adopts this character in real life as a young privileged white person. In contrast, the artist is also interested in how drinking alcohol can be an empowering posture for woman as it allows her to take ownership over this male-determined activity.

The performance took place on October 12th, 2012. In this video performance, the artist is 21 years old.
