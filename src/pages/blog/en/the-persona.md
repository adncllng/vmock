In this performance for video, the artist gets drunk and dances to music in front of a camera. Partying, as a social activity and character trait, is here isolated for observation. With this action, Mockler wanted to investigate why she adopts this character in real life as a young privileged white person.

The performance took place on October 12th, 2012.

In this video performance, the artist was 21 years old.
