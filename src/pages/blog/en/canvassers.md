  Video performance on the political potential of impromptu face-to-face
  personal story sharing
---
Mich and Marshall are asked to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both participants arrive at a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally expressed by the other. This continuous one-shot 15-minute video performance demonstrates our empathetic capacity as individuals. Part performance, part documentary, this piece was created in response to recent scientific findings that have demonstrated a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two strangers can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice¹. These findings inspired this video-performance in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s recurring exploration of human interaction as a method for social-political transformation.
