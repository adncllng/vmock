  Video performance based on a scientific study demonstrating the political
  potential of impromptu face-to-face personal story sharing.
---
Mich and Marshall are asked to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both participants come to experience a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other. This continuous one-shot 15-minute video performance demonstrates our empathetic capacity as individuals. Part performance, part document, this piece was made in response to recent scientific findings that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two strangers can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice. These findings inspired this performance for video in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s recurring use of human interaction as social political transformation.
