  Repetition, trust and testimony set the stage for a one of a kind video
  performance.

I asked friends Mich and Marshall to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both of them arrive at a unified understanding of events when they orally repeat the experience the other has just shared. Part performance, part documentary, this continuous one-shot 15-minute video was created in response to scientific findings I've stumbled upon that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two strangers can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.ยน ([click _here_ for study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_d54y2l0_NaRUdBcENwbThZRmM/view?usp=sharing)). These findings inspired this video-performance in addition to bringing the first empirical premise to my recurring exploration of human interaction as an art practice and literal method for social-political transformation.
