  Video performance on the political potential of impromptu face-to-face
  self-revelation.

I asked friends Mich and Marshall to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both of them arrive at a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other. Part performance, part documentary, this continuous one-shot 15-minute video was created in response to scientific findings I've stumbled upon that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two strangers can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.¹ ([click _here_ for study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_d54y2l0_NaRUdBcENwbThZRmM/view?usp=sharing)). These findings inspired this video-performance in addition to bringing the first empirical premise to my recurring exploration of human interaction as an art practice and literal method for social-political transformation.
