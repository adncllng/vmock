  Gathering online with a community of women & nonprofit migrant rights
  organization.

The artist began a series of online gatherings with women who are part of Action Réfugiés Montréal's twinning program. In this work, she looks at what it means to gather online, through art-making. The artist is interested in how such facilitation can be considered a performance practice that enacts social engagement and support.  

Isolation during the pandemic takes on a whole other dimension if you've just managed to reach refuge in a new country. How can one start to establish 'some sort' of secure set-up for themselves and their family, while usual resources and support systems are shut down? Moreover, some individuals who sought asylum remain to this day (May 2020) detained by the Canadian Government in Laval. Action Réfugiés Montréal have pivoted in order to be able to continue their work and provide daily support to people in detention, maintain connection, evaluate the needs of newly arrived folks and accompany people, one person at a time.

Veronica Mockler has been invited to contribute in this pivot. She hopes that these bi-weekly gatherings will allow many times, spaces and states to recharge and continue.
