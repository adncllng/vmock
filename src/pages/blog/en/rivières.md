  A series of documentary citizen performances on eight Côte-des-Neiges
  residents.
---
Rivières is a series of documentary performances the artist Veronica Mockler co-created with theatre artist Sofia Blondin. At the intersection of performance, installation and documentary, this artwork was about the lives and experiences of eight individuals living in the Côte-des-Neiges borough of Montreal. This series of  documentary performances was based on two elements: a soundtrack playing the edited version of an audio interview the two women artist had done with the resident, and the physical performance of this resident in front of the audience. Over the course of two days, 250 montrealers wander through the walls of the borough’s community center complexe to witness the presence and stories of eight complete strangers. 

VISIBLE woud like to thank the City of Montreal – vive375mtl fund, the Arrondissement Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Theatre Engaging Communities Program of the National Theatre School of Canada and the Centre Communautaire de Loisir de Côte-des-Neiges.
